	<p>I attended the Center for Natural Wellness in New York, and have been a licensed massage
therapist for 10 years. I have been in bodywork full time since then, having worked at top spas
in Albany and Philadelphia. My goal is to marry effective deep tissue and its measurable results
with a deeply relaxing experience that facilitates subtle healing as well.
	<p>I found my way to massage therapy after earning a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from MICA, or
the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore. I developed a deep appreciation for and
understanding of human anatomy there, which led directly to my interest in bodywork.
	<p>I lovingly practice Shiatsu and Reiki as well. While deep tissue work accounts for the great
majority of my appointments, I seek to infuse even these sessions with an Eastern energetic
component.
	<p>My practice is a safe place for all bodies.
Massage is about wellness, and everybody deserves the opportunity to care for themselves in
this way. Medical histories, medication regiments, and personal identities are sometimes
barriers to effective care when we cannot be sure a practitioner practices sensitivity and
non-judgement. My promise to you on or off the massage table, is that you have my respect and
my commitment to your healing.
	<p>Another barrier to holistic self care can be cost. Because I believe that everyone deserves
massage in their life, I welcome a dialogue with you if your personal finances are prohibitive.
